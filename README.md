# infinity
Infinity Protocol Backbone
A brief example of the technology behind Infinity protocol is as follows //
import ccxt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Initialize exchange object
exchange = ccxt.binance()

# Define the symbol (e.g. BTC/USDT)
symbol = 'BTC/USDT'

# Define the timeframe (e.g. 1 hour)
timeframe = '1h'

# Get historical OHLCV data
ohlcv = exchange.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe)
df = pd.DataFrame(ohlcv, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])

# Calculate the MACD line
fast_window = 12
slow_window = 26
signal_window = 9

df['fast_ema'] = df['close'].ewm(span=fast_window).mean()
df['slow_ema'] = df['close'].ewm(span=slow_window).mean()
df['macd'] = df['fast_ema'] - df['slow_ema']
df['signal'] = df['macd'].ewm(span=signal_window).mean()
df['histogram'] = df['macd'] - df['signal']

# Define the trading logic
if df['histogram'].iloc[-1] > 0 and df['histogram'].iloc[-2] < 0:
    # Buy
    print('Buy signal')
elif df['histogram'].iloc[-1] < 0 and df['histogram'].iloc[-2] > 0:
    # Sell
    print('Sell signal')
else:
    # Hold
    print('Hold signal')

the code present is one of the 26 coditions that have to be met for us 16 conditions are fully developed by our team.

10 indicators are know and available to the public , this 10 indicators give a winning chance of 47% which is not ideal specially if the bots are on 24/7
once our 26 conditions are met the trade has a success rate of 78%.

an other example or just the tip of the iceberg of our code is //

study("My Trading Bot")

// Define the symbol and timeframe
symbol = "BTC/USDT"
timeframe = "1h"

// Retrieve the historical close prices
price = close

// Calculate the moving averages
fastMA = sma(price, 50)
mediumMA = sma(price, 100)
slowMA = sma(price, 200)

// Define the trading logic
if (fastMA > mediumMA) and (mediumMA > slowMA)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
else if (fastMA < mediumMA) and (mediumMA < slowMA)
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)
else
    strategy.close("No Trade")

'sma() function to calculate the moving averages of the close prices with window sizes of 50, 100, and 200. The trading logic is defined in the last part of the code. If the fast moving average (50) is above the medium moving average (100) and the medium moving average is above the slow moving average (200), the bot will generate a "Long" signal to enter a long position. If the fast moving average is below the medium moving average and the medium moving average is below the slow moving average, the bot will generate a "Short" signal to enter a short position. Otherwise, the bot will generate a "No Trade" signal to close any open positions.

lastly an example that includes the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), moving averages, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators:

scss

study("My Trading Bot")

// Define the symbol and timeframe
symbol = "BTC/USDT"
timeframe = "1h"

// Retrieve the historical close prices
price = close

// Calculate the moving averages
fastMA = sma(price, 50)
mediumMA = sma(price, 100)
slowMA = sma(price, 200)

// Calculate the MACD line
fastEMA = ema(price, 12)
slowEMA = ema(price, 26)
macd = fastEMA - slowEMA
signal = sma(macd, 9)
histogram = macd - signal

// Calculate the RSI
rsi = rsi(price, 14)

// Define the trading logic
if (fastMA > mediumMA) and (mediumMA > slowMA) and (rsi > 50) and (histogram > 0)
    strategy.entry("Long", strategy.long)
else if (fastMA < mediumMA) and (mediumMA < slowMA) and (rsi < 50) and (histogram < 0)
    strategy.entry("Short", strategy.short)
else
    strategy.close("No Trade")

the sma() and ema() functions to calculate the moving averages and the MACD line, respectively. The RSI is calculated using the rsi() function. The trading logic is defined in the last part of the code. If the fast moving average is above the medium moving average and the medium moving average is above the slow moving average, the RSI is above 50, and the MACD histogram is positive, the bot will generate a "Long" signal to enter a long position. If the fast moving average is below the medium moving average and the medium moving average is below the slow moving average, the RSI is below 50, and the MACD histogram is negative, the bot will generate a "Short" signal to enter a short position. Otherwise, the bot will generate a "No Trade" signal to close any open positions.
